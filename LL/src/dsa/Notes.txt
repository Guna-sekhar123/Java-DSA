Big-O :- The time complexity of the program at worst case scenario
pass by value :- changes the original value which was stored in the heap memory
memory in programing was like heap and stack memory
The reference variables are stored in stack memory and the values/ objects are stored in heap memory
variables, arrays, maps, lists, queues, stacks, priority queues, linked lists,tress, graphs
searching algos:- binary search
sorting algos:- merge, selection, insertion, cyclic sort, bubble sort

Bit manupulation:-
    Left shift:   a << b == a * 2^b (a and b are int)
                  a << 1 == 2*a ( a will be doubled)
    Right shift:  a >> b == a / 2^b(a and b are int)
                  a >> 1 == halve ( the starting bit will be ignored)
    XOR       :  a ^ 1 = ~a
                 a ^ a = 0
                 a ^ 0 = a
